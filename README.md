Rigor and Reproducibility HOMEWORK 

1.) Open a pull request and let your teacher know that you’ve finished this course.

I edited the README.md file in git-github-fundamentals-alirosen and selected "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request."

2.) Create a new markdown file in this repository. Let them know what you learned and what you are still confused about! Experiment with different styles!

This is the new markdown document. This module taught me how to navigate GitHub, like how to start a new project and create subdocuments within that project. I learned that repositories (where you're projects occur) contain README.md files and created a new branch (alirosen-patch-1) and used a pull request to tell my teacher that I had completed the module. I can merge this branch into my main branch when it is complete. 
I'm still confused about how to distribute GitHub entries to others and how to apply GitHub to my bioinformatics work.

3.) Create your profile README. Let the world know a little bit more about you! What are you interested in learning? What are you working on? What's your favorite hobby? Learn more about creating your profile README in the document, "Managing Your Profile README".

I created a new repository (alirosen) and answered these questions in the README document.

4.) Go to your user dashboard and create a new repository. Experiment with the features within that repository to familiarize yourself with them.

Created a new repository (alirosen_test) and created a README.

5.) Let us know what you liked or didn’t like about the content of this course. What would you like to see more of? What would be interesting or helpful to your learning journey?

This was super useful! My bioinformatics teacher uses GitHub and I didn't know the platform before so this is helpful to gain familiarity.
